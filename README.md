# Caesar-cipher
A simple caesar cipher that convert user input(string) into cipher text by a user-defined shift value.


What this program does:
-This Python script encrypts a message using the Caesar Cipher.
-You type a message and a shift number.
-The program shifts each letter by that amount and prints the encrypted text.

How it works
-Only letters A–Z are shifted (message is converted to uppercase).
-Non-letters (spaces, numbers, punctuation) stay the same.
-The alphabet “wraps around” — for example, shifting Z by 1 becomes A.

How to use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the message you want to encrypt.
3. Enter a shift key (a whole number).
4. The program prints the encrypted message.
